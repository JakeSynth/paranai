      <p>A boisterous and menacing race that always seeks challenge. Beastmen flex their strength often seen placing highly in tournaments throughout Paranai. Their reign as guardians to nobility and bounty hunters makes them one of the most feared races in the lands.</p>

      <p>Noble and ready for a fight, the Beastmen of Shafa dominate the wilds of the jungle with raw strength. The spellcasters of the tribe specialise in close-range battle magics to overwhelm their opponents. There is a reason the northern Gallis&#39;set jungle is considered their undisputed territory.</p>

          <b class="big"><u>Age</u></b> Beastmen have life spans a little shorter than humans, reaching adulthood around 15 and lives averaging 60 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Most Beastmen are methodical hunters, using their stature to intimidate opponents and as such are usually <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="tn">True Neutral</a>.

          <b class="big"><u>Bloodied Steel</u></b> Cutting an opponent down in battle fills the Beastmen with glorious fortitude. When you incapacitate/kill an enemy in battle you can immediately cast the race-exclusive cantrip <i><b>Feral Roar</b></i> for free.

    <h2 class="sectionheader">Background & Origin</h2>
      <p>Greybacks. Chatterers. Songwings. Burrowers. The many nicknames of Coleoptera stem from their unimaginable number of specialisations. While some are more common than others; the bug-people of Paranai are far from consistent even when coming from the same brood. At the age of five they forgo their larval form letting their carapace undergo rapid change.<br><br>Size? Colour? Legs? Wings? Strength? Speed? Everything is in question as seemingly overnight the bone-white grubs burst into their true forms. Their tunnels stretch almost everywhere deep below Acrostai but cetain exits to the great hive are travelled more than most.</p>

        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Ability Score Increase</u></b> Your <b>Constitution</b> score increases by 1. You additionally gain an ability score increase unique to the subrace you choose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Age</u></b> A Coleoptera reaches adulthood at the age of 5 and generally lives to 100 to 200. Royal Coleoptera can live to be 450 under the right circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Most Coleoptera are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="cn">Chaotic Neutral</a>, following their whims, holding their personal freedom and providing for the hive above all else. They form strong bonds with party members but can put people in danger with their reckless actions. A Coleoptera willing to change their minds is a rare sight but a few possess a caring and selfless disposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Size</u></b> An average Coleoptera stands a little under four feet tall when fully mature and weighs an average of one hundred and fifty pounds. Your size is <b>Small</b>.

    <h2 class="sectionheader">Background & Origin</h2>
      <p>Geists are wailing spirits who inhabit anything hollow they can find. Geists have attempted to make deals with blacksmiths or threaten them in order to have a reinforced living space, however in a pinch a Geist can climb into Jars, Pots, Barrels, or other similar <b>unowned Vessels</b>. To possess owned property Geists need to bargain with its owner or creator, often ending in someone's death. Their foul natures mean they are often shunned by society and taverns close their doors to them. Many exploring Geists hide their true nature with trinkets or shape changing magics that allow them to pose as another.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Age</u></b> As long as Geists inhabit a <b>Vessel</b> their essence doesn&#39;t decay. This makes them some of the oldest beings recorded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Most Geists are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="ce">Chaotic Evil</a>, doing what they need to do to keep their <b>Vessels</b> alive. As a rule, they are selfish beings, inquisitive and wise, often unleashing fury on creatures that pose a threat to their life. Different circumstances breed different Geists however and so many alignments have been observed even up to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="cn">Lawful Neutral</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big">Size</u></b> Geists can inhabit <b>Vessels</b> of many varying sizes. The size of a Geist is determined by your DM once a <b>Vessel</b> is agreed upon and again each time a new <b>Vessel</b> is taken/found. A typical <b>Vessel</b> is <b>Medium</b> or <b>Small</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Speed</u></b> Your base walking speed is <b>30 feet</b>. Outside of a <b>Vessel</b> this decreases to <b>10 feet</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Darkvision</u></b> You have the ability to see in the dark up to <b>120 feet</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Languages</u></b> You can speak, read, and write <b>Common</b> and <b>two languages</b> from your past.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Vessel Frailty</u></b> A Geist cannot face the world unaided for long. They must contain themselves within a hollow object to stay alive. Once their <b>Vessel</b> is destroyed the party has <b>3 turns</b> (or <b>3 minutes</b> out of combat) to find another suitable <b>Vessel</b> or face watching the dissipation of their friend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Destruction</u></b> When a Geists health hits 0 it must make a <b>Survival</b> check of at least 8 + your <b>Vessel's</b> size to keep it's <b>Vessel</b> together. This check is made before a <b>Death Save</b>. If the check is met the <b>Death Save</b> can be made as usual but if the <b>Survival</b> check failed, the <b>Vessel</b> ignites in holy light and erupts, dealing <b>1d10</b> to <b>4d10</b> <b>Force</b> damage to all units within <b>15-30 feet</b> (Depending on <b>Vessel</b> size) and the Geist falls unconscious.<br>The inventory of a Geist is scattered/destroyed when this happens; however high enough <b>Perception</b> checks may be able to find weapons, tools, or other items in the rubble. While the Geist is outside of a <b>Vessel</b> it is subject to the effects of <b><u>Vessel Frailty</u></b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Acquiring Upgrades</u></b> Geists can directly upgrade their <b>Vessels</b> by finding skilled blacksmiths or artificers that can alter that which they inhabit. Because their lives are lived within a <b>Vessel</b>, the idea of armor to protect them seems useless and they often go without, opting instead for carrying a few jars on them to transfer into just in case. Blacksmiths may be able to alter the <b>Vessels</b> by fashioning legs, arms, or plating. Wizards could alter more abstract characteristics, like size, shape, colour, or material (if enough of the desired material is brought along with the request).<br>Geists are not without their needs however and so are confined to <b>Vessels</b> from sizes <b>Tiny</b> to <b>Large</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Millenia of Study</u></b> Geists have advantage on <b>Intelligence</b> checks against magic and proficiency in <b>Intimidation</b>, <b>Arcana</b>, and <b>History</b>.

    <h2 class="sectionheader">Background & Origin</h2>
    <p>Stricken with an unholy sickness and cast from the world. The people taken by the Lycan each night were once ordinary but be it an accident or malicious attack, their lives before are over. Those with Lycanthropy usually steal sleep during the day so they can stay awake and hold off the Lycan at night. When they transform they lose their sense of self, still able to communicate with others but forgetting the names of people and common objects. The wickedness of their condition does not necessarily mean they are evil. Those who have interacted with the Lycan often describe them as more eccentric than malicious. Many victims maintain their personalities after transforming which allows them to stay good aligned. They remember the events of the night even if they had no influence over them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>A Lycan's Past</u></b> You present as a <b>scarred wanderer of another race</b> when not in your Lycan form and in doing so gain their <b class="big"><u>Ability Score Increase</u></b>, <b class="big"><u>Age</u></b>, <b class="big"><u>Size</u></b>, <b class="big"><u>Speed</u></b>, and <b class="big"><u>Darkvision</u></b>. You do not inherit their race specific traits.<br>The way you got the Lycanthropic disease can vary greatly, but the scar is always a factor. Where the scar is placed on the body is up to you, but the chest, face, back, or arms are the most likely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Some Lycan live in fear of what they have become. Others wholly embrace the Lycan when it calls. Whatever the case, they are shunned from society and most seek a cure to the incurable and freedom from their twisted form. They are most likely <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="ng">Neutral Good</a>, but the bitterness of being forgotten can turn many to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="ne">Evil</a>.
        </li>

          <b class="big"><u>The Wretched Disease</u></b> Lycanthropy leaves the host shell of their former self. Your memories before your transformation are fragmented and foggy but your senses are now unnaturally heightened. You have disadvantage on <b>History</b> checks but advantage on <b>Perception</b> and <b>Investigation</b> checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Nightfall</u></b> At nightfall you become consumed by the disease and transform into a vicious monster. This effect can be held off with <b>Concentration</b> and the touch of a holy symbol throughout the night but applies a stack of <b><i>Exhaustion</i></b> if you do so. Otherwise, you grow to around 8 feet tall and your size becomes <b>Large</b>. Your weight triples and you grow a snout, large fang-like teeth, claws on your hands and feet, and fur covering the majority of your body. At 3rd level you deal an additional <b>1d8</b> <b>slashing</b> damage with your claws per melee attack. Every three levels beyond 3rd level you gain an additional <b>1d8</b> to this attack up to 12th level for a maximum of <b>4d8</b>. This effect takes place regardless if you are in the light of the moon or not at 8pm. (Or a time your DM deems appropriate.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Daybreak</u></b> The light of day tames the beast and you revert to your normal form, losing the effects of <b><u>Nightfall</u></b>. If you transform back from the Lycan during battle you lose the effects of <b><u>Nightfall</u></b>. This effect takes place regardless if you are in the daylight or not at 6am. (Or a time your DM deems appropriate.)
        </li>

        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Aversion to Faith</u></b> Symbols of faith anger the beast within you. While <b><i>Transformed</i></b>, if an enemy has a holy symbol visible or speaks a holy incantation, prayer, or channels divinity in your line of sight you become <b><i>Taunted</i></b> by them.<br><br><b class="big" ><u>Taunt</u></b> You become fixated on a target and feel compelled to perform an attack against them. Once the attack is performed you are no longer <b><i>Taunted</i></b>.

          <b class="big"><u>Spore Swarm</u></b> You may take an action to release a mist of deadly spores in the surrounding area centered on a square within <b>120 feet</b>. The spread of these spores and damage type are determined by your Mushling's <b>Cap Color</b> and <b>Spot Color</b> chosen from the <b><u>The Spore-Father's Gift</u></b> trait. All creatures in the area at the start of their turn must make a <b>Constitution</b> saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 6 + your <b>Charisma</b> modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes <b>1d6</b> damage on a failed save each turn for the duration they are in the area, and half as much damage on a successful one. At 6th level if the target stays within the area for <b>3 turns</b> they flip a coin; On heads they contract <b><u>Fungal Fever</u></b>. The damage increases to <b>2d6</b> at 11th level, and <b>3d6</b> at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

      <p>The Others usually keep their physical form cloaked in full body robes wearing bright-white or painted masks to hide their gaseous form. It might seem advantageous to be this way, however their bodies still take up physical space and so objects or attacks against them cause them pain just as any other. Moving through the shadows makes for quick travel but being caught out by the light of a city guard's lantern means either a difficult escape or gruesome fight.</p>

        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Most Others live in solitary, stealing what they need and keeping out of the public eye. They are generally honest, paying for what they take and saving lives as much as they take them. Their <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="ng">Neutral Good</a> nature is often overshadowed by powerful gang-bosses who seek to use their capabilities for crime.

Enemies that notice you and choose to target you with an attack or spell do so freely. Your armor barely covers the mass and as such you take a penalty of -3 AC while in this form.<br>When cast in light that would remove the shadows you are hidden within you are forced into your humanoid form and <b><u>Dive Into Shadows</u></b> is cancelled.

          <b class="big"><u>Shadow Assassin</u></b> While in the shadows and under the effects of <b><u>Dive Into Shadows</u></b> you may move through tiles occupied by other creatures who are at least partially cast in shadow. If you end a movement action within an occupied tile and have not performed an attack during this round you may burst from the shadows and engulf the target in smoke. Performing this on an enemy who has not noticed you counts as a surprise attack and you gain all the benefits of doing so. If the target has a held action or concentration spell active when you perform this the actions are cancelled and immediately end, regardless of if your attack hits.

Slimes most often take on the classes of the creature they absorb, picking up their weapons and armor to carry on as if they've always lived the life of the host.</p>

          <b class="big"><u>Imitate Voices</u></b> Slimekin are able to change the shape of their vocal chords to imitate the voices of those they've previously encountered. This can only be used in languages the Slime knows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Hold Forms</u></b> Slimes can use <b>Concentration</b> to change their form to take on the shape of any creature they have seen, however their bodies keep their gelatinous look. A Slimekin must possess enough <b>Ooze</b> to create the form which can be hollow if it helps achieve the size needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Ooze</u></b> A slime&#39;s goop doesn&#39;t grow on trees. The form of a Slime is made up of Ooze which is created in the digestion of rations or other food/drink. A full health normal Slime is <b>Medium</b> sized and when fully healed will return to this size. When attacked or injured <b>Ooze</b> will be cut off the Slime and slightly change its size.<br>If too much <b>Ooze</b> is lost the Slime will change size until they are as small as a squishy skull, covered in ooze, slithering on the floor. A Slime can consume extra food to increase its size but this will not add any bonus health beyond the Slime&#39;s maximum health and the size will be lost if the Slime takes damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Poison Trail</u></b> Slimekin leave a trail of acidic poison behind them that decays after <b>2 minutes</b>. Creatures that step in the trail receive <b>2d6 Poison</b> damage and have disadvantage on <b>Dexterity</b> and <b>Constitution</b> checks for <b>1 hour</b>. Walking on surfaces softer than stone or glass corrodes them. Slimes are immune to this trail.

          <b class="big"><u>Age</u></b> Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Alignment</u></b> Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments" title="Click to go through to Wikipedia for a more in depth explanation of Alignment." class="ng">Lawful Good</a>. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.

        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Size</u></b> Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is <b>Medium</b>.

        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Speed</u></b> Your base walking speed is <b>30 feet</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Darkvision</u></b> Tortles do not possess Darkvision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Languages</u></b> You can speak, read, and write <b>Common</b> and <b>Aquan</b>.

        <li> 
          <b class="big"><u>Claws</u></b> Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to <b>1d4</b> + your <b>Strength</b> modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Natural Armor</u></b> Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your <b>Dexterity</b> modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Shell Defense</u></b> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on <b>Strength</b> and <b>Constitution</b> saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on <b>Dexterity</b> saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="big"><u>Survival Instinct</u></b> You gain proficiency in the <b>Survival</b> skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.
